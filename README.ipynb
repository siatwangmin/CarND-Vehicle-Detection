    "* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier\n",
    "* a color transform and append binned color features to my HOG feature vector.　features　normalization and randomization of training and testing dataset are conducted\n",
    "* a sliding-window technique is adopted to propose candidate regions for car, and the regions are input into a trained classifier\n",
    "* a pipeline works on a video stream and a heat map is created for recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
